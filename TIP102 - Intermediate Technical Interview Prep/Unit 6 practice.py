'''Problem 1: Building a Playlist
The assignment statement to the top_hits_2010s variable below creates the linked list Uptown Funk -> Party Rock Anthem -> Bad Romance. 
Break apart the assignment statement into multiple lines with one call to the Node constructor per line to recreate the list.'''

from collections import defaultdict

class SongNode:
    def __init__(self, song, next=None):
        self.song = song
        self.next = next

# For testing
def print_linked_list(node):
    current = node
    while current:
        print(current.song, end=" -> " if current.next else "")
        current = current.next
    print()

'''Problem 2: Top Artists
Given the head of a linked list playlist, return a dictionary that maps each artist in the list to its frequency.

Evaluate the time complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.'''
class SongNode_artist:
    def __init__(self, song, artist, next=None):
        self.song = song
        self.artist = artist

    artist_count = defaultdict(int)
    current = playlist

    while current:
        # get count of current.artist in playlist:
        artist_count[current.artist] += 1
        current = current.next
    return artist_count

'''Problem 3: Glitching Out
The following code attempts to remove the first node with a given song from a singly linked list with head playlist_head but it contains a bug!

Step 1: Copy this code into Replit.

Step 2: Create your own test cases to run the code against, and use print statements and the stack trace to identify and fix the bug so that the function correctly removes a node by value from the list.

Step 3: Evaluate the time and space complexity of the fixed solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe the solution has the stated time and space complexity.'''

# For testing

            return playlist_head 
        current = current.next

    return playlist_head

'''Problem 4: On Repeat
A variation of the two-pointer technique introduced in previous units is to have a slow and a fast pointer that increment at different rates.

We would like to check whether our playlist loops or not. Given the head of a linked list playlist_head, return True if the playlist has a cycle in it and False otherwise. 
A linked list has a cycle if at some point in the list, the nodeâ€™s next pointer points back to a previous node in the list.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.'''

        fast = fast.next.next
        if slow == fast:
            return True
    return False

'''Problem 5: Looped
Given the head of a linked list playlist_head that may contain a cycle, use the fast and slow pointer method to return the length of the cycle. If the list does not contain a cycle, return 0.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.'''
def loop_length(playlist_head):
    count = 0
    slow = fast = playlist_head
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        count += 1
        if slow == fast:
            return count 
    return 0

'''Problem 6: Volume Control
You are working as an engineer normalizing volume levels on songs. Given the head of a singly linked list with integer values song_audio representing volume levels at different points in a song, 
return the number of critical points. A critical point is a local minima or maxima.

The head and tail nodes are not considered critical points.
A node is a local minima if both the next and previous elements are greater than the current element
A node is a local maxima if both the next and previous elements are less than the current element
Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.'''
