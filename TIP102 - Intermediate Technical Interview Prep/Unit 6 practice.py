As a biologist, you are working on editing a long strand of DNA represented as a linked list of nucleotides. Each nucleotide in the sequence is represented as a node in the linked list,

Given the head of the linked list dna_strand and two integers m and n, write a function edit_dna_sequence() that simulates the selective deletion of nucleotides in a DNA sequence. 
You will: - Start at the beginning of the DNA strand. - Retain the first m nucleotides from the current position. - Remove the next n nucleotides from the sequence. - Repeat the process until the end of the DNA strand is reached.

'''Problem 2: Protein Folding Loop Detection
As a biochemist, you're studying the folding patterns of proteins, which are represented as a sequence of amino acids linked together. 
These proteins sometimes fold back on themselves, creating loops that can impact their function.

Given the head of a linked list protein where each node in the linked list represents an amino acid in the protein, return an array with the values of any cycle in the list. 
A linked list has a cycle if at some point in the list, the nodeâ€™s next pointer points back to a previous node in the list.

'''Problem 3: Segmenting Protein Chains for Analysis
As a biochemist, you are analyzing a long protein chain represented by a singly linked list, where each node is an amino acid. 
For a specific experiment, you need to split this protein chain into k consecutive segments for separate analysis. Each segment should be as equal in length as possible, 
with no two segments differing in size by more than one amino acid.

The segments should appear in the same order as the original protein chain, and segments earlier in the list should have a size greater than or equal to those occurring later. 
If the protein chain cannot be evenly divided, some segments may be an empty list.

Write a function split_protein_chain() that takes the head of the linked list protein and an integer k, and returns an array of k segments.

You have a list of experiment results for two types of experiments conducted in alternating order represented by a singly linked list. 
Each node in the list corresponds to an experiment result, and the position of the result in the 1-indexed sequence determines whether it is odd or even.

Given the head of the linked list, exp_results, reorganize the experiment results so that all results in odd positions are grouped together first, followed by all results in even positions. 
The relative order of the results within the odd group and the even group must remain the same as the original sequence. The first result in the list is considered to be odd, the second result is even, and so on. Return the head of the reorganized list.
