Given the head of the linked list dna_strand and two integers m and n, write a function edit_dna_sequence() that simulates the selective deletion of nucleotides in a DNA sequence.

'''Problem 3: Segmenting Protein Chains for Analysis
As a biochemist, you are analyzing a long protein chain represented by a singly linked list, where each node is an amino acid. 
For a specific experiment, you need to split this protein chain into k consecutive segments for separate analysis. Each segment should be as equal in length as possible, 
with no two segments differing in size by more than one amino acid.

The segments should appear in the same order as the original protein chain, and segments earlier in the list should have a size greater than or equal to those occurring later. 
If the protein chain cannot be evenly divided, some segments may be an empty list.

Write a function split_protein_chain() that takes the head of the linked list protein and an integer k, and returns an array of k segments.

You have a list of experiment results for two types of experiments conducted in alternating order represented by a singly linked list. 
Each node in the list corresponds to an experiment result, and the position of the result in the 1-indexed sequence determines whether it is odd or even.

Given the head of the linked list, exp_results, reorganize the experiment results so that all results in odd positions are grouped together first, followed by all results in even positions.

Contestants, today's challenge is to sort a linked list of items the fastest! The catch - you have to follow a certain technique or you're disqualified from the round. 
Youâ€™ll start with an unsorted lineup, and with each step, youâ€™ll move one item at a time into its proper position until the entire lineup is perfectly ordered.

Given the head of a linked list, sort the items using the following procedure:

Start with the first item: The sorted section initially contains just the first item. The rest of the items await their turn in the unsorted section.
Pick and Place: For each step, pick the next item from the unsorted section, find its correct spot in the sorted section, and place it there.
Repeat: Continue until all items are in the sorted section.
Return the head of the sorted linked list.

As a preview, here is a graphical example of the required technique (also known as the insertion sort algorithm). 
The partially sorted list (black) initially contains only the first element in the list. One element (red) is removed from the input data and inserted in-place into the sorted list with each iteration.
